# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

0- Function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
   Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
   size is the number of elements in array
   And value is the value to search for
   Function must return the first index where value is located
   If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
   Every time compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value 

1- Function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
   Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
   size is the number of elements in array
   And value is the value to search for
   Function must return the index where value is located
   Asume the array will be sorted in ascending order
   Assume the value wonâ€™t appear more than once in array
   If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
   You must print the array being searched every time it changes. (e.g. at the beginning and when you search a subarray)
