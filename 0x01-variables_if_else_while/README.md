# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

0- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

1- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

2- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); All the code should be in the main function; Only use putchar twice in your code

3- Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e; Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); All the code should be in the main function; Only use putchar twice in your code.

4- Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); All the code should be in the main function; Only use putchar three times in your code

5- Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All the code should be in the main function

6- Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char; You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); You can only use putchar twice in your code; All your code should be in the main function

7- Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); All the code should be in the main function; Only use putchar twice in your code

8- Program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); All the code should be in the main function; Only use putchar three times in your code

9- Program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space; Numbers should be printed in ascending order; Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All the code should be in the main function; Only use putchar four times maximum in your code; Not allowed to use any variable of type char.

10- Program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits; Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); Only use putchar five times maximum in your code; Not allowed to use any variable of type char; All the code should be in the main function

100- Program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space; The two digits must be different; 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
Print only the smallest combination of two digits; Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits; Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); Only use putchar five times maximum in your code; Not allowed to use any variable of type char; All the code should be in the main function

101- Program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space; The three digits must be different; 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
Print only the smallest combination of three digits; Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits; Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); Only use putchar six times maximum in your code; Not allowed to use any variable of type char; All the code should be in the main function

102- Program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. The numbers should range from 0 to 99; The two numbers should be separated by a space; All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01; The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space; The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1; Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden); Only use putchar eight times maximum in your code; Not allowed to use any variable of type char; All the code should be in the main function
