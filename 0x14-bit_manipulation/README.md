# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

0- Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. Where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars; Return: the converted number, or 0 if there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1; b is NULL

1- Function that prints the binary representation of a number. 

2- Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get; Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

3- Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set; Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

4- Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set; Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

5- Function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

100- Function that checks the endianness. Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian
